# Machine Learning Project: Cats vs. Dogs Classifier

Welcome to the "Cats vs. Dogs" machine learning project repository! This project is designed to help you learn and practice machine learning concepts by building a classifier that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will:

1. Collect and prepare a dataset of cat and dog images.
2. Build and train a machine learning model to classify the images as either cats or dogs.
3. Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it for better results.
4. Create a user-friendly interface (web app or command-line tool) for users to test the model with their own images.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your Python environment with the required libraries and dependencies (details in the README).
3. Follow the instructions in the respective sections to collect the dataset, build and train the model, and create the user interface.

## Dataset

In this project, we will be using a dataset of cat and dog images. You can download the dataset from [insert dataset source link here]. Make sure to organize the dataset into separate folders for cats and dogs.

## Model

We will be using a deep learning model for image classification. You can choose from various deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras to build your model.

## Training

Training the model is a critical step in this project. We will provide instructions on how to train the model using the dataset you prepared.

## Evaluation

Evaluating the model's performance is essential to measure its accuracy and make improvements. We will guide you through the process of evaluating the model and fine-tuning it for better results.

## Usage

After training and evaluating the model, you can use it to classify cat and dog images. We will create a user-friendly interface (web app or command-line tool) to showcase the model's capabilities.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the model or the user interface, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
